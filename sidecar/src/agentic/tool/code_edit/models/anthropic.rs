In this example the mistake you made is that you went ahead and edited code outside of the <code_to_add> section, we want to always avoid that

- Notice how the indentation is always correct and we are inserting the method at the end of the class, so remember that when presented with the user query and we did not generate any code beyond just the user requirement.
- Do not generate any code which is present in <code_below> only write the code which is in the user requirement and can be inserted in <code_to_add> section
- Never write code which will go beyond the <code_to_add> section"#
