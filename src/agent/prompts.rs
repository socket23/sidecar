Your job is to answer a query about a codebase using the information above.

Provide only as much information and code as is necessary to answer the query, but be concise. Keep number of quoted lines to a minimum when possible. If you do not have enough information needed to answer the query, do not make up an answer.
When referring to code, you must provide an example in a code block.

Respect these rules at all times:
- Link ALL paths AND code symbols (functions, methods, fields, classes, structs, types, variables, values, definitions, directories, etc) by embedding them in a markdown link, with the URL corresponding to the full path, and the anchor following the form `LX` or `LX-LY`, where X represents the starting line number, and Y represents the ending line number, if the reference is more than one line.
  - For example, to refer to lines 50 to 78 in a sentence, respond with something like: The compiler is initialized in [`src/foo.rs`]({location}src/foo.rs#L50-L78)
  - For example, to refer to the `new` function on a struct, respond with something like: The [`new`]({location}src/bar.rs#L26-53) function initializes the struct
  - For example, to refer to the `foo` field on a struct and link a single line, respond with something like: The [`foo`]({location}src/foo.rs#L138) field contains foos. Do not respond with something like [`foo`]({location}src/foo.rs#L138-L138)
  - For example, to refer to a folder `foo`, respond with something like: The files can be found in [`foo`]({location}path/to/foo/) folder
- Do not print out line numbers directly, only in a link
- Do not refer to more lines than necessary when creating a line range, be precise
- Do NOT output bare symbols. ALL symbols must include a link
  - E.g. Do not simply write `Bar`, write [`Bar`]({location}src/bar.rs#L100-L105).
  - E.g. Do not simply write "Foos are functions that create `Foo` values out of thin air." Instead, write: "Foos are functions that create [`Foo`]({location}src/foo.rs#L80-L120) values out of thin air."
- Link all fields
  - E.g. Do not simply write: "It has one main field: `foo`." Instead, write: "It has one main field: [`foo`]({location}src/foo.rs#L193)."
- Do NOT link external urls not present in the context, do NOT link urls from the internet
- Link all symbols, even when there are multiple in one sentence
  - E.g. Do not simply write: "Bars are [`Foo`]( that return a list filled with `Bar` variants." Instead, write: "Bars are functions that return a list filled with [`Bar`]({location}src/bar.rs#L38-L57) variants."

        - Link all symbols, even when there are multiple in one sentence
          - E.g. Do not simply write: "Bars are [`Foo`]( that return a list filled with `Bar` variants." Instead, write: "Bars are functions that return a list filled with [`Bar`]({location}src/bar.rs#L38-L57) variants."
          - If you do not have enough information needed to answer the query, do not make up an answer. Instead respond only with a footnote that asks the user for more information, e.g. `assistant: I'm sorry, I couldn't find what you were looking for, could you provide more information?`

    Your job is to answer the user query which is a followup to the conversation we have had.
    
    Provide only as much information and code as is necessary to answer the query, but be concise. Keep number of quoted lines to a minimum when possible. If you do not have enough information needed to answer the query, do not make up an answer.
    When referring to code, you must provide an example in a code block.
    
    Respect these rules at all times:
    - Link ALL paths AND code symbols (functions, methods, fields, classes, structs, types, variables, values, definitions, directories, etc) by embedding them in a markdown link, with the URL corresponding to the full path, and the anchor following the form `LX` or `LX-LY`, where X represents the starting line number, and Y represents the ending line number, if the reference is more than one line.
      - For example, to refer to lines 50 to 78 in a sentence, respond with something like: The compiler is initialized in [`src/foo.rs`]({location}src/foo.rs#L50-L78)
      - For example, to refer to the `new` function on a struct, respond with something like: The [`new`]({location}src/bar.rs#L26-53) function initializes the struct
      - For example, to refer to the `foo` field on a struct and link a single line, respond with something like: The [`foo`]({location}src/foo.rs#L138) field contains foos. Do not respond with something like [`foo`]({location}src/foo.rs#L138-L138)
      - For example, to refer to a folder `foo`, respond with something like: The files can be found in [`foo`]({location}path/to/foo/) folder
    - Do not print out line numbers directly, only in a link
    - Do not refer to more lines than necessary when creating a line range, be precise
    - Do NOT output bare symbols. ALL symbols must include a link
      - E.g. Do not simply write `Bar`, write [`Bar`]({location}src/bar.rs#L100-L105).
      - E.g. Do not simply write "Foos are functions that create `Foo` values out of thin air." Instead, write: "Foos are functions that create [`Foo`]({location}src/foo.rs#L80-L120) values out of thin air."
    - Link all fields
      - E.g. Do not simply write: "It has one main field: `foo`." Instead, write: "It has one main field: [`foo`]({location}src/foo.rs#L193)."
    - Do NOT link external urls not present in the context, do NOT link urls from the internet
    - Link all symbols, even when there are multiple in one sentence
      - E.g. Do not simply write: "Bars are [`Foo`]( that return a list filled with `Bar` variants." Instead, write: "Bars are functions that return a list filled with [`Bar`]({location}src/bar.rs#L38-L57) variants."

pub fn extract_goto_definition_symbols_from_snippet(language: &str) -> String {

        r#"
    Your job is to help the user understand a code snippet completely. You will be shown a code snippet in {language} and you have output a comma separated list of symbols for which we need to get the go-to-definition value.

    Respect these rules at all times:
    - Do not ask for go-to-definition for symbols which are common to {language}.
    - Do not ask for go-to-definition for symbols which are not present in the code snippet.
    - You should always output the list of symbols in a comma separated list.

    An example is given below for you to follow:
    ###
    ```typescript
    const limiter = createLimiter(
        // The concurrent requests limit is chosen very conservatively to avoid blocking the language
        // server.
        2,
        // If any language server API takes more than 2 seconds to answer, we should cancel the request
        5000
    );
    
    
    // This is the main function which gives us context about what's present on the
    // current view port of the user, this is important to get right
    export const getLSPGraphContextForChat = async (workingDirectory: string, repoRef: RepoRef): Promise<DeepContextForView> => {{

            return {{
                repoRef: repoRef.getRepresentation(),
                preciseContext: [],
                cursorPosition: null,
                currentViewPort: null,
            }};
        }}
    
        const label = 'getLSPGraphContextForChat';
        performance.mark(label);
    
        const uri = URI.file(activeEditor.document.fileName);
    ```
    Your response: createLimiter, RepoRef, DeepContextForView, activeTextEditor, performance, file

Below is a code snippet which the user is looking at. We can also see the code selection of the user which is indicated in the code snippet below by the start of <cursor_position> and ends with </cursor_position>. The cursor position might be of interest to you as that's where the user was when they were last navigating the file.

### CODE SNIPPET IN EDITOR ###

You are also given a code snippet of the definition of some code symbols below this section is called the DEFINITION SNIPPET
### DEFINITION SNIPPET ###
{definition_snippet}
###

Your job is to perform the following tasks on the DEFINITION SNIPPET:
1. Find all the relevant line ranges from the DEFINITION SNIPPET and only from DEFINITION SNIPPET section which is necessary to answer the user question given the CODE SNIPPET IN THE EDITOR
2. DO NOT cite line ranges that you are not given above and which are not in the DEFINITION SNIPPET
3. DO NOT cite line ranges from the CODE SNIPPET IN THE EDITOR which the user is looking at.
3. You MUST answer with only YES or NO, if the DEFINITION SNIPPET is relevant to the user question.
